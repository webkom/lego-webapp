# Usage

The `Icon` component extends the Ionicons icons library. For that reason, you must install this package separately.

Place the following <script> near the end of your page, right before the closing </body> tag, to enable them.

```html
<script
  type="module"
  src="https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js"
></script>
<script
  nomodule
  src="https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.js"
></script>
```
