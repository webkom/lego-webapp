Basic content should automatically be responsive by composing responsive classes like `contentContainer`.
If you want to completely hide something on mobile, add the `hiddenOnMobile` class. Be hesitant to use this, as we do not want the mobile version to have any less functionality than the
full version.

Make sure to double check that your feature is responsive; this is 2017.
