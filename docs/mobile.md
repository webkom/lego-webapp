Basic content should automatically be responsive by composing responsive classes like `contentContainer`.
If you want to completely hide something on mobile, add the `hiddenOnMobile` class. Be hesitant to use this, as we do not want the mobile version to have any less functionality than the
full version.

Make sure to double check that your feature is responsive; this is 2017.

__PROTIP__: If you have an Android device, Google Chrome DevTools allows you to debug and forward ports to your device easily. This is called  [remote-debugging](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/remote-debugging/), and gives you the exact same developer tools you have in Chrome, on you Android device. This works on all chromium based browsers, that means all webviews, all versions of chrome, and also oem versions like Samsung Internet Browser.
