## Documentation
For simple component documentation we use [react-docgen](https://github.com/reactjs/react-docgen), with [react-styleguidist](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist) for easy style guide generation.

Start dev server (with hot reload), and go to [localhost:6060](http://localhost:6060/).
```bash
$ yarn styleguide
```

To build a static version of the documentation, run:
```bash
$ yarn styleguide:build
```


## Text Editor
[Atom](https://atom.io) with these plugins installed provides the best developer experience:
```bash
$ apm install nuclide pigments linter-eslint linter-stylelint prettier-atom
```

## Prettier
We use [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) for JS auto-formatting. It will run as a git pre-commit hook, but you can also install the [prettier-atom](https://atom.io/packages/prettier-atom) Atom plugin.

## Tests
Run all the tests and check for lint errors with the command:
```bash
$ yarn test
```

For development you can run the tests continuously by using:
```bash
$ yarn run test:watch
```

A coverage report can be generated by running `yarn test -- --coverage`.

## Flow
[Flow](https://flowtype.org/) is gradually being introduced so we can reap the benefits of static type checking.

Run `flow` in the project directory to check if everything is good.

## Linting
ESLint and Stylelint is used to maintain high code quality and a unified code style. Please run them before committing code.

To run the linter, use:
```bash
$ yarn run lint

# or
$ yarn run lint:js
$ yarn run lint:css
```

Some ESLint errors can be fixed by running
```bash
$ yarn run lint:js -- --fix
```
