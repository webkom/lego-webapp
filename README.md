## Build for production
```
$ yarn run build
$ NODE_ENV=production node webpack/server.js
```

## Text Editor
[Atom](https://atom.io) with these plugins installed provides the best developer experience:
```bash
$ apm install nuclide pigments linter-eslint linter-stylelint
```

## Tests
Run all the tests and check for lint errors with the command:
```
$ yarn test
```

For development you can run the tests continuously by using:
```
$ yarn run test:watch
```

## Flow
[Flow](https://flowtype.org/) is gradually being introduced so we can reap the benefits of static type checking.

Run `flow` in the project directory to check if everything is good.

## Linting
ESLint and Stylelint is used to maintain high code quality and a unified code style. Please run them before committing code.

To run the linter, use:
```bash
$ yarn run lint

# or
$ yarn run lint:js
$ yarn run lint:css
```

Some ESLint errors can be fixed by running
```bash
$ yarn run lint:js -- --fix
```
